Code, data and docs for Listen 2 Manchester project

Python code and any relevant data files are split into the following basic folder structure:

## /Drakewell 
This contains the main project files - comparing the seismological signature of urban noise (specifically, traffic) 
with traffic count data from Drakewell cameras around Manchester (courtesy of the Manchester-i project, Manchester 
Urban Observatory https://www.urbanobservatory.manchester.ac.uk/ and https://manchester-i.com/). This draws on the previous work and code from Thomas Lecoq (https://github.com/ThomasLecocq) and David N. Green et al., 2017 Seismological Research Letters.  

## /Earthquakes
Seismograms for various events - local to UK and further afield, as recorded by the RShakes in this 'network'. Some 
comparisons to nearest BGS boradband stations for reference. These scripts have been based on those by Mark Vanstone (https://github.com/wmvanstone) and Steve Hicks (https://github.com/shicks-seismo). 

## /Football
Spectrograms and filtered seismograms for local football matches, borrowing heavily on the expertise of Paul Denton, 
who oversaw the VardyQuakes project in Leicester (https://github.com/pdtdenton).

## /General
Odds and ends I didn't know where else to store.
