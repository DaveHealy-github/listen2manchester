Code, data and docs for Listen 2 Manchester project

Python code and any relevant data files are split into the following basic folder structure:

## /Drakewell 
This contains the main project files - comparing the seismological signature of urban noise (specifically, traffic) 
with traffic count data from Drakewell cameras around Manchester (courtesy of the Manchester-i project, Manchester 
Urban Observatory https://www.urbanobservatory.manchester.ac.uk/ and https://manchester-i.com/)

## /Earthquakes
Seismograms for various events - local to UK and further afield, as recorded by the RShakes in this 'network'. Some 
comparisons to nearest BGS boradband stations for reference. 

## /Football
Spectrograms and filtered seismograms for local football matches, borrowing heavily on the expertise of Paul Denton, 
who oversaw the VardyQuakes project in Leicester. 

## /General
Odds and ends I didn't know where else to store.
